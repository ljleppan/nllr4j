The law, proposed by Prime Minister Branko Mikulic, goes into effect on July 1 and aims to end a long-standing practice of supporting unprofitable companies. Under the law, wage cuts will be imposed on losing enterprises, while those failing to recover within a six-month grace period will face liquidation.     The diplomats said Mikulic's attempt to create a market economy is inevitable, but has still come as a shock to those accustomed to government subsidies.     \"It was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed, but if an overdose is taken too abruptly, it may have adverse effects on the system,\" a Western diplomat said.     He said if the law was applied too strictly it would probably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest.     Yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following the introduction of a wage-freeze law, later amended to allow more flexibility and some exemptions in what some political analysts saw as a retreat by Mikulic.     But with inflation moving towards 100 pct, trade union leaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take.     The union leaders said workers thoughout the country are already receiving salaries below limits set under existing law, while others have received no wages at all this year because their employers are unable to pay them.     Workers also complain much of their income is taken in local, state and federal taxes.     Many others are losing their motivation to work and confidence in government as they feel their decision-making powers are being eroded, trade union officials said.     Meanwhile, the official Tanjug news agency reported a paper and cellulose factory at Ivangrad in the Montenegro republic closed yesterday and 2,000 of its workers were given \"temporary leave.\"     Tanjug said the plant had been running at a loss for the 24 years it had been in operation, and its closure was the result of \"economic necessity\" rather than bankruptcy.

The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.     Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low.     Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.  REUTER\n");

A hearing is scheduled Monday on Texaco's motion to reduce the amount of bond required by Texas state law to secure a 1985 judgment in favour of Pennzoil Co <PZL> in a dispute over the acquisition of Getty Oil.     Pennzoil today said it proposed to the court that Texaco secure its bond with assets valued at about 50 pct of the bond.     It said this would not force Texaco into bankruptcy.     Richard Brinkman, Texaco's chief financial officer, said in a newly filed affidavit that the company was willing to use its 65 mln shares of <Texaco Canada Inc> as collateral for a letter of credit or loan to provide security to Pennzoil.     The Canadian unit's stock, valued at about 1.8 billion dlrs, was returned to Texaco earlier this week after being held as security by a federal district court in New York while Texaco awaited a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. Brinkman estimated that Texaco could borrow no more than one billion dlrs using its Canadian subsidiary stock as collateral for a loan.     Texaco, he said, was unwilling to pledge the stock of its other foreign subsidiary corporations as security because the stock is not widely traded and its market value was unclear.     Brinkman also said the company had already lost access to a four billion dlr revolving credit line since the initial jury verdict against Texaco.     Texaco had been able to raise working capital by selling about 700 mln dlrs in receivables to a group of banks since the judgment, he said. The banks earlier this week notified Texaco that they would not purchase any additional receivables because of the company's uncertain status, Brinkman said.     Four other credit agreements for 1.15 billion dlrs would also be cut off if a judgment of more than four billion dlrs is outstanding against the company and it is unable to obtain a stay, Brinkman said.     \"Since the Supreme Court decision on April 6, many other suppliers to Texaco have notified Texaco that their dealings with it are under review and a number have demanded cash payment or terminated their dealings with Texaco,\" he said.     The Supreme Court overturned a lower federal court decision to cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, saying the issue should first be considered in Texas courts.     In a separate affidavit, <Morgan Stanley & Co> Managing Director Donald Brennan also said Texaco would be forced into bankruptcy if the company were forced to provide Pennzoil with security exceeding one billion dlrs.

Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week.     However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.     Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods.     Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.

They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all.     Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates.     The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure.     The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly.     They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency's recent movements.     They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other.     The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies.     Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said.     In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said.     Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.     This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies.     At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said.  REUTER \n");
